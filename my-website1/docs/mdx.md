title: Certification Process 
---

 
### First
We are going to test some scenarios to ensure that your implementation meets the scenarios for certification and being able to grant your production keys.
 
Some scenarios that we are going to test.
- That you provide to the final user (In some way) the auth number and the PIN(if it’s available).
- Successful transactions.
- Duplicate transactions.
- Error messages and response code.
- Handler timeout transactions.

:::note
- Consider that you need to provide by email screenshots in each step that Gestopago requires for the certification from your final platform(App, portal web, etc)
- Consider that you need to provide by email the request and response of each tested transaction
:::

We’ll share with you our document to test the scenarios [Gestopago sandbox Recharge/services](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtlc6xuD4TN77qBeYA8W0_VRLgXU5viL2_hljnPdwcQ/edit?usp=sharing) (Send us the request grant).
 
### Second
Administration setup and create your production keys that we are going to provide by email with a zip and provide to you the password by phone.
 
### Third
Review a few transactions in production.

:::note

- The certification is an EndToEnd process, Platform(App, portal web, etc) -> Gestopago -> Platform(App, portal web, etc).
- Unit tests are not allowed for the certification process.
